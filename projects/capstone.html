            </div>
            <p>At most Canadian universities, engineering students are required to take a 2 semester class that consists
              in a project commonly known as the Capstone Project.
              I was no exception to that rule, and for my Capstone project, my team and I had to build an elevator
              traffic management system.
              <br>
              Our capstone project focused on developing a face recognition system for an elevator traffic management
              solution. The primary objective was to improve efficiency and security within high-rise buildings by
              automating elevator operations based on individual identification.
              <br>
              My role in the project involved two key responsibilities. Firstly, I was responsible for implementing the
              facial recognition component using AWS services. Leveraging AWS's capabilities, I utilized advanced
              algorithms and machine learning techniques to create an accurate face recognition system. Amazon
              Rekognition played a crucial role in providing facial analysis and recognition capabilities, ensuring
              reliable performance.
              <br>
              In addition, I contributed to the construction of the web application that served as the central interface
              for building administrators and security personnel. As part of this role, I focused on frontend
              development, aiming to create a user-friendly interface for efficient elevator traffic monitoring.
              Seamlessly integrating the face recognition system into the web app allowed administrators to access
              real-time information, review logs of identified individuals, and manage system settings effectively.
              <br>
              To establish seamless communication between system components, I also built the necessary API. This API
              facilitated secure and efficient data exchange between the face recognition module, database, and web
              application. The API design prioritized smooth data retrieval, storage, and synchronization, ensuring the
              overall system's cohesion.
              <br>
              Unfortunately, I can't show source code or product demos, as it is a final year project so it's protected
              under certain regulations.
              However, we did end up with a good grade, testimony of the hard work we put into our project.
