            <p>For an Artifical Intelligence class, I was tasked with doing a Classification Empirical Study. Here was
              the description:
              <br>The overall goal of this project is to perform a classification empirical study and document it. More
              specifically, the goal is to get familiar with the experimental set-up required for a classification
              problem, as well as to further explore 3 classification algorithms/models seen in class.
              <br>Here were the steps we followed to complete our project:
            <ul>
              <li>1. Understand the classification task for your dataset
                <ul>
                  <li>a. Is it a binary/multi-class classification? </li>
                  <li>b. What is the goal? Is this for a particular application?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>2. Analyze your dataset
                <ul>
                  <li>a. Characterize the dataset in terms of number of training examples, number of features, missing
                    data,
                    etc.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>3. Brainstorm about the attributes (Feature engineering)
                <ul>
                  <li>a. Think about the features that could be useful for this task, are they all present in the
                    dataset?
                    Anything missing? Any attribute provided that doesn’t seem useful to you?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>4. Encode the features
                <ul>
                  <li>a. As you will use models that need discrete or continuous attributes, think about data encoding
                    and
                    transformation.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>5. Prepare your data for the experiment, using cross-validation</li>
              <li>6. Train at least these 3 models using some default parameters. You should use ALL the following
                models:
                <ul>
                  <li>a. Naïve Bayes</li>
                  <li>b. Logistic Regression</li>
                  <li>c. Multi-Layer Perceptron</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>7. Test your 3 models using cross-validation (provided the split in step 5)</li>
              <li>8. Perform an evaluation with precision/recall measures</li>
              <li>9. For each type of model, modify some parameters, and perform a train/test/evaluate again. Do this
                for two times.</li>
              <li>10. Analyze the obtained results
                <ul>
                  <li>a. Compare quantitatively (with the precision/recall measures) your 9 results. The 9 results come
                    from
                    3 models, each with default parameters from step 6 + 2 variations from step 9.</li>
                  <li>b. Show some examples of results that are good and not good (false positives and false negatives),
                    try
                    to understand why and discuss.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br> The analysis we made, using different classifiers, led to one and only conclusion: According to our
            research France was the winner of the 2022 World Cup.
            However, after having watched the World Cup, the real winners were Argentina. They did in fact beat France
            in the final, so maybe we were onto something.
            <br>For obvious plagiarism issues, I would rather not show any of my code publicly, but you can have my word
            that we at least guessed some of it right.
